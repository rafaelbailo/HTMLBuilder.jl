Currently, it can:\n\nGenerate HTML code.\nParse HTML code.\nBuild a site with multiple pages.\n\nAll the HTML elements are treated as Julia structs, so you can easily generate HTML programmatically. For instance, we can list the first N Fibonacci numbers. First we import HTMLBuilder.jl and define the Fibonacci function, as well as N=5:\n\nusing HTMLBuilder\nFibonacci(n::Int) = (n <= 2) ? (1) : (Fibonacci(n - 1) + Fibonacci(n - 2));\nN = 5;\n\nThen, we can construct the list by nesting HTML elements and using a for loop:\n\nbody(\n  h1(\"The Fibonacci numbers\"),\n  p(\"Here are the first $N Fibonacci numbers:\"),\n  ul([li(string(Fibonacci(n))) for n ∈ 1:N]),\n)\n\nHTMLBuilder.jl can be used to build and manage a complex site through the @build_site macro. The example directory contains a site directory populated with Julia code. The @build_site macro parses these files and generates dist, a complete HTML site.
